# Dice Game
a terminal-based mini game built using Python3. Inspired from the classic Colored Dice Game at Casinos.

## Objective
To apply and combined all I learned from studying Python for 3 weeks. BTW, I learned Batch file when I was a Kid so i have a basic knowledge on how If/Else, print, and variables work.

## How to play?
At the start of the game, the default setting will automatically gives you P 1000 as credit to play. Next, choose the number where you want to bet and keep in mind that betting on a single number on Dice has Minimum and Maximum bet limit.

Once you already placed your bet, you can now Press [enter] to Roll the dice.

You will WIN once your chosen number appears on the rolled dice. If your chosen number appeared 2x, the payout will be 2x of your bet on that number. If 3x, the payout is 3x.

Previous Dice result, Win/Loss, amount win / lose can be also seen up to 8 previous games.

At settings, you can change the Currency sign. "P" was the default since I'm using 'Peso' here in my country, you can use $ sign as long it's only single character Currency sign. You can also change the Minimum bet limit but not the Maximimum bet limit to maintain the Balance, Maximum Bet limit is always Minimum bet limit * 200. Lastly, you can increase your credit up to P 20000 but you can only do this once your credit drops below P 10.

## About the game
This game was inspired from a classic Colored Dice Game at Casinos. So yeah, do not expect to win on this game since the computation applies the House Advantage of a Casino.
